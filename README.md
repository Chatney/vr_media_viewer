## VR media viewer
I wanted to have a VR image viewer to browse old photos and relive them vividly.<br/>

So this is an attempt at making a 3d VR viewer for image and video files that does not require any preprocessing.<br/>
You can manipulate the image to be really IN it, and browse to the next by using your VR controllers.<br/>

Using Unity Sentis and a depth_anything onnx model to create a mesh, and projecting the image frame.<br/>
The mesh uses the full float16 depth information, so the depth resolution has no stair-stepping as opposed to rendering it to a compressed image first.<br/>

## Photos
Image display works pretty well, even for extreme image resolution, so that uses the depth_anything-v2_vit_L model.<br/>
The full resolution image is projected onto the lower resolution mesh, so higher resolution images look way better than video.<br/>
For a 40MP image, on a RTX3090, generating the mesh and material takes about 0.5 seconds, so I guess this might also work on lower end computers.<br/>

## Video
The video playback works but is pretty janky and taxing. So video uses the depth_anything-v2_vid_B model.<br/>
For < 1080p videos the framerate is passable at best, and the pause button is broken (works, but janky). But still very cool.<br/>
For video, the depth values are not normalized in any way, this means that the resulting mesh is pretty stable.<br/>

In my experience making a full build makes the video playback a lot smoother as compared to just pressing play in the editor.<br/>

## Yes
-Single-threaded spaghetti.<br/>
-If you have no image after pressing the pause button, press the video timeline and it should maybe reappear.<br/>
-If you lost the file browser, look up. You most likely scrolled very far and it somehow doesn't reset the scroll position when loading a new folder.<br/>
