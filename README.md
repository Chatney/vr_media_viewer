Attempt at making a 3d VR viewer for image and video files
by using Unity Sentis and a depth_anything onnx model to create a mesh, and projecting the image frame.

Image display works pretty well, even for extreme image resolution, so that uses the vit_L model.
Te full resolution image is projected onto the lower resolution mesh, so higher resolution images look way better than video.
For a 40MP image, on a RTX3090 generating it takes about 0.5 seconds to generate the mesh and material, so I guess this might also work on lower end computers.

The video playback works but is pretty janky and taxing. So video uses the vid_B model
For < 1080p videos the framerate is passable at best, and the pause button is broken (works, but janky). But still very cool.
